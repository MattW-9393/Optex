#### OptEx ---> ToDo List

### 🔁 1. **Extract and Save Table Data**

* Loop through each row of the current workout table.
* Use `map()` or a similar method to extract exercise name, sets, and reps from each row.
* Store this row data in a structured format (like an array of objects).
* Push this structured workout into a larger array that holds all saved workouts.

---

### 💾 2. **Prompt for Workout Template Name**

* When the user chooses to save the workout:

  * Use `prompt()` or a form field to ask for a workout name.
  * Associate that name with the array of workout data (e.g. `{ name: "Leg Day", data: [...] }`).
  * Optionally show a confirmation with `alert()` to confirm the save.

---

### 📄 3. **Display Saved Templates on a Separate Page**

* On your templates page, iterate over all saved workouts.
* For each one, dynamically create a button labeled with the workout name.

---

### 🧱 4. **Render the Chosen Workout Template**

* When a user clicks one of the workout buttons:

  * Use DOM manipulation to build a new table based on the saved workout's data.
  * Populate the new table with rows for each exercise, just like the original one.
